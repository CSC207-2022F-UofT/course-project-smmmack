- [ ] Please create a username for each player.
- [ ] All the players will be initiated with a fixed amount of Monopoly cash at the start of the game.
- [ ] Each player will have consecutive turns, set at the start of the game.
- [ ] For the rest of the game rules and how to play, please refer to the UofTorontopoly Manual below.

**If you have any questions about starting the game, 
please refer to the 'UofTorontopoly Manual' below for help.**

## UofTorontopoly Manual

* Github Workflow: Please refer to the workflow that was introduced in the first lab. You should follow this when working on your code. The following document provides additional details too.

* [Project Planning and Development Guide](project_plan_dev.md): This document helps you to understand how to create and maintain a project plan for your class project. **This document helps you to complete the Implementation Plan Milestone.**

## Gradle Project
Import this project into your Intellij editor. It should automatically recognise this as a gradle repository.
The starter code was built using SDK version 11.0.1. Ensure that you are using this version for this project. (You can, of course, change the SDK version as per your requirement if your team has all agreed to use a different version)

You have been provided with two starter files for demonstration: HelloWorld and HelloWorldTest.

You will find HelloWorld in `src/main/java/tutorial` directory. Right click on the HelloWorld file and click on `Run HelloWorld.main()`.
This should run the program and print on your console.

You will find HelloWorldTest in `src/test/java/tutorial` directory. Right click on the HelloWorldTest file and click on `Run HelloWorldTest`.
All tests should pass. Your team can remove this sample of how testing works once you start adding your project code to the repo.

Moving forward, we expect you to maintain this project structure. You *should* use Gradle as the build environment, but it is fine if your team prefers to use something else -- just remove the gradle files and push your preferred project setup. Assuming you stick with Gradle, your source code should go into `src/main/java` (you can keep creating more subdirectories as per your project requirement). Every source class can auto-generate a test file for you. For example, open HelloWorld.java file and click on the `HelloWorld` variable as shown in the image below. You should see an option `Generate` and on clicking this your should see an option `Test`. Clicking on this will generate a JUnit test file for `HelloWorld` class. This was used to generate the `HelloWorldTest`.

You can create another simple class and try generating a test for this class.
